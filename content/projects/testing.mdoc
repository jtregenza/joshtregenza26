The clinical task with patients suffering from identity diffusion is not only to interpret unconscious dynamics but also to help them gradually establish continuity, authenticity, and a coherent sense of self. This requires a stance of *empathetic confrontation*: drawing attention to contradictions in a manner that is compassionate rather than shaming. Empathy involves seeing the full person, in all their complexity, difficulties, struggles, angst, emptiness, and hardships. Confrontation may seem opposed to empathy, yet it serves as a compassionate search for truth—a deepening of the patient’s reflective functioning around life portions obscured by shame-fueled denial or repression. Patients who rely heavily on splitting will often react to the most recent interaction while disavowing or ignoring previous behavior. Simply pointing out discrepancies can be destabilizing; instead, the therapist should bring them into awareness with empathy, framing the contradiction as understandable given the patient’s inner fragmentation. In this way, the clinician models reflective functioning, enabling the patient to tolerate ambivalence and integrate disowned aspects of self and other.

Lack of temporal continuity presents another therapeutic challenge. Kernberg (2008) emphasized that the repetition compulsion (an effort to secure the idealized object and undo past trauma) prevents the accumulation of new experiences that could stabilize a life narrative. Patients may feel trapped in a perpetual present, disconnected from both their past and their future selves. Interventions here should focus on shifting the patient out of reenactments and toward the internalization of healthier relational experiences. Enactments will also happen in sessions with you, their therapist, and they may even project into you aspects of their traumatic upbringing that might draw you into uncharted waters for your normal behavior, thoughts and fantasies, or you may notice disruptions in the frame. Supervision will help in case you find yourself in rough waters. Each moment of reliable attunement in the therapeutic relationship becomes a building block for a more cohesive sense of identity, gradually interrupting the cycle of repetition and opening space for continuity.

Authenticity, too, is a central therapeutic aim. Patients with identity diffusion often struggle to distinguish between healthy forms of identification (such as aspiring to embody a valued mentor) and pathological mimicry aimed at filling an inner void. The clinician’s role is to listen closely for authentic notes, even when faint–perhaps in a patient’s firm refusal, a deeply felt boundary, or a glimpse of personal value. Sometimes these come through in art, writing, poetry, microexpressions, bodily sensations, or dreams. Attuning to these moments with curiosity and compassion can help strengthen the patient’s authentic voice, buried as it often is under shame, dissociation, or compulsive compliance. Therapy thus becomes a process of amplifying these fragile but genuine signals of selfhood.

The experience of chronic emptiness also requires careful clinical handling. Patients may attempt to “fill the container” through acting out, compulsive behaviors, or self-destructive pursuits. Such actions are less about desire than about warding off the intolerable void of non-being. Here, the therapist’s task is to hold the emptiness in mind without rushing to fill it, offering containment and interpretation of how such behaviors function to avoid the terror of inner hollowness. By tolerating this emptiness alongside the patient, the therapist helps transform it into an experience that can be thought about rather than compulsively enacted.&nbsp;
